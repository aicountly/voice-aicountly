/**
 * Loading AICOUNTLY Connect's embed loader — once, asynchronously, and never at
 * Voice's expense.
 *
 * `${connectOrigin}/embed/v1/loader.js` defines `window.AICountlyChat` (alias
 * `AICountlyConnect`); the widget itself is fetched by that loader, from its own
 * directory, and renders in a shadow root on its own element under <body>. What
 * this file guarantees on the Voice side:
 *
 *  - ONE script tag per page, however many times it is asked for;
 *  - a hard timeout, so a Connect that hangs is a Connect that is not there;
 *  - every failure (offline, blocked, a 404, a loader that did not register)
 *    resolves `null` — nothing throws into Voice, and at most one warning is
 *    written to the console, however often it is asked afterwards.
 *
 * The contract is connect-aicountly docs/EMBED_SDK.md (v1).

/**
 * The AICOUNTLY accounts signed in on this browser.
 *
 * The portal keeps up to five sign-ins per browser (my-aicountly-com
 * `App\Libraries\AccountRoster`). Two cookies carry them, both on
 * `.aicountly.com`, so both arrive at every product host:
 *
 *   AIC_ACCOUNTS       httpOnly — the tokens themselves. Unreadable here, and
 *                      meant to be: switching is the portal's decision, never
 *                      this app's.
 *   AIC_ACCOUNTS_VIEW  readable — the same roster as labels. Name, subscriber
 *                      id, MASKED e-mail and mobile. Nothing in it authorises
 *                      anything, which is why it may be read from JavaScript at
 *                      all (the portal's API is cross-origin to every product
 *                      and does not accept credentials, so this cookie is the
 *                      only channel the menu actually has).
 *
 * Everything that CHANGES an account — switching, adding, signing one out — is
 * a navigation to the portal, which checks the httpOnly roster. Editing the
 * readable cookie changes labels on one screen and nothing else.
 *
 * This file is a deliberate TWIN of notes-aicountly `web/src/auth/accounts.ts`
 * and books-react-app `web/src/services/accounts.js`. Only the imports differ.
 * Keep the three in step — the contract they implement is
 * `AICOUNTLY_MULTI_ACCOUNT.md` in the Saas Common Handler, and a product that
 * drifts from it is a product whose menu lies about who is signed in.

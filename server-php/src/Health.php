 * What /api/health can honestly say about Voice's database.
 *
 * Nothing this product currently serves depends on it — every existing route
 * is portal-relay only — so this never gates `status`. It exists so a
 * database, once one is added here, is visible and debuggable from day one
 * rather than silently broken until the first feature that needs it ships.
 *
 * This endpoint is UNAUTHENTICATED and public, so failures are categorised
 * rather than passed through: a driver message like "Access denied for user
 * 'x'@'y'" names the account and host to anyone who asks. The full message
 * goes to the error log, where the person fixing it can read it.

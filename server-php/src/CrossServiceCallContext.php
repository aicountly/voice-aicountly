/**
 * Who issued the request this process is serving, so we never call them back
 * inside it.
 *
 * NOT a recursion guard — nothing recurses. Each AICOUNTLY product runs in its
 * own PHP-FPM pool with a small pm.max_children, and a synchronous HTTP call
 * parks the calling worker for the whole round trip. When A calls B and B calls
 * A back, three workers across two pools serve one user action and two of them
 * are sitting in read(). At a handful of concurrent users every child in both
 * pools is blocked on the other and the queue answers 504. A depth counter
 * inside one process cannot see this, and raising pm.max_children only makes
 * the deadlock more expensive to reach.
 *
 * See books-react-app/docs/CROSS_SERVICE_CALL_RULES.md — this is the fleet-wide
 * invariant that document records.
 *
 * Receptionist is the case that matters most here: it calls Appointments to
 * find and book slots, and Appointments shows Receptionist's contribution on a
 * dashboard. Without this guard a booking arriving from Receptionist would have
 * Appointments calling Receptionist back mid-request.
 *
 * The header GRANTS NOTHING. It can only ever suppress one of our outbound
 * calls, so forging it costs the forger enrichment they wanted; it cannot
 * create access, a row or a permission. Unknown values are ignored.

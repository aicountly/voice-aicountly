/**
 * The company / branch scope every scoped request carries.
 *
 * Two ids and nothing else. The company's name, its branches and their
 * addresses belong to Manage and are read from Manage at the point of use — a
 * branch whose address was copied once is a branch that keeps the old address
 * after somebody corrects it.
 *
 * NO FINANCIAL YEAR. Books, Sales and Purchases scope by `fy_id` because a
 * voucher belongs to an accounting period. A phone call does not: a call placed
 * on 31 March and its callback on 1 April are one conversation and nobody
 * closes a year against them. Usage and cost reporting carries its own explicit
 * period (see Dashboards\Period), which is a different thing.
 *
 * TENANT ISOLATION: `cmp_id` arriving in a query string is a claim, not a fact.
 * assertAllowed() checks it against what Manage says this session may open, and
 * a company the session has no access to is a 403 — never a query that simply
 * returns nothing, which would leak the difference between "no rows" and "not
 * yours" and would break the moment a query forgot its WHERE clause.
 *
 * This matters more here than in most products: the rows behind this scope are
 * call recordings and transcripts of private conversations.

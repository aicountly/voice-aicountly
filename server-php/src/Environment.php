/**
 * Which deployment this is — production, sandbox or local — read from SERVER
 * CONFIGURATION ONLY.
 *
 * ## Why this is not derived from the request
 *
 * Every sibling host Voice talks to — Manage (the tenant check), Contacts, CRM,
 * Calendar, Pay, AI Pulse — used to be chosen from `HTTP_HOST`. Whatever a
 * request says its Host is, it is a claim: a default vhost, an IP request or a
 * misrouted proxy can present `localhost` or `*.gh.aicountly.com` to the
 * production deployment, and the tenant check would then be asked of SANDBOX
 * Manage, where the same cmp_id belongs to a different business. A CLI worker
 * has no Host at all, and an empty Host used to mean "sandbox" — so a
 * production campaign worker would have read sandbox Contacts.
 *
 * So the environment comes from `AIC_ENVIRONMENT` (the fleet-wide name), or
 * `APP_ENV` when that is not set. An unknown or missing value is NOT a
 * guess at production or sandbox: callers get null and refuse to reach any
 * sibling, which an administrator sees and fixes in minutes. Guessing is how
 * production data ends up in a sandbox.

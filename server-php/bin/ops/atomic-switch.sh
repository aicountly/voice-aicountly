# atomic-switch.sh — put a release live with ONE rename, so no request ever runs a mix of old and new code.
#
# CANONICAL COPY: console-react-app/ops/estate/kit/bin/ops/atomic-switch.sh — identical in every product at
# server-php/bin/ops/atomic-switch.sh (release.sh calls it when release.conf sets ATOMIC=1; products without
# release.sh call it from their deploy workflow over SSH).
#
# Why: deploys used to rsync the new code OVER the live api/ folder while it served requests. For the
# seconds (Books) to minutes (Inventory) that took, a request could load some new files and some old ones
# and die before answering: an empty HTTP 500, "The server hit an unexpected error and gave no details",
# sometimes after the change it carried had been saved.
#
# Layout (outside the document root, so no release is ever reachable by URL):
#   <releases-dir>/releases/<UTC time>-<revision>/   one complete copy of the code per deploy
#   <releases-dir>/shared/<path>                     runtime state every release shares (--shared)
#   <live>  ->  <releases-dir>/releases/<current>    the live path is a symlink, swapped by rename(2)
#
#   bash atomic-switch.sh --src=<prepared code> --live=<docroot>/api --revision=<sha> \
#        [--releases-dir=<dir>] [--shared=writable/logs ...] [--env-file=.env] [--keep=5] \
#        [--check-url=https://host/api/health]
#   bash atomic-switch.sh --rollback --live=<docroot>/api [--releases-dir=<dir>] [--check-url=...]
#   bash atomic-switch.sh --status   --live=<docroot>/api [--releases-dir=<dir>]
#
#  - The release folder is built completely BEFORE the switch: code copied from --src (hard-linked with
#    the current release where unchanged, so five kept releases cost little disk), the live .env (and
#    .env.* but .env.example) carried over from the CURRENT release so edits made on the server are kept,
#    each --shared path replaced by a symlink into shared/, REVISION written.
#  - The first run converts a plain api/ folder: each --shared path is moved into shared/ and a symlink
#    left in its place (the old code keeps writing to the same files), then api/ is renamed aside and the
#    symlink renamed into place — two renames in the same folder, microseconds apart. The old folder is
#    moved out of the document root afterwards and kept as releases/<time>-pre-atomic.
#  - --check-url: after the switch the URL must answer 2xx/3xx within 20 s, or the previous code is put
#    back at once (on the first run: the original plain folder). A host that does not follow symlinks
#    therefore costs one failed check, not an outage.
#  - PHP resolves the symlink per request (realpath cache up to ~2 min), so a worker may finish serving the
#    previous release for a short while — always a WHOLE release; previous releases are kept (--keep).
#

#             21 check failed, previous code restored · 22 check failed AND restore failed (act now)
